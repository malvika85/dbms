Additional Information

* Changed one line in test.cc
 15 //  while ((res = temp.SuckNextRecord (rel->schema (), src)) && ++proc < numrecs) {
 16     while( proc < numrecs && (res = temp.SuckNextRecord (rel->schema (), src)) ){
 17         proc++;

* We have written our own EventLogger.
  The files for it are: EventLogger.cc and EventLogger.h
  They have been added in Makefile

* There are some memory leaks in Schema.cc, because of which valgrind run failed.
  As you said, we except not to get our marks deducted for memory leaks :)
